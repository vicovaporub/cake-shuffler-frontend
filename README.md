# Cake Shuffler

## Description

This is a simple and fun project I made for a friend that bakes cakes. She's a bit undecided for the flavors she will bake for the day, so I made this app to help her and test my fullstack coding skills.

This is the frontend for the app, uses React (Nextjs) and TypeScript and consists in a form to add new cake flavors to a database and a button to get a random cake flavor to bake.

The backend for this app is in this repo: [Cake Shuffler Backend](https://github.com/vicovaporub/cake-shuffler-backend)
